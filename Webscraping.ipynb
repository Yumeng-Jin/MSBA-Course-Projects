I have some small sets of shelves, office chairs, a hutch, dinner wear, and small tables for free, too, but you have to take a big item to take one of those.Tell me which you want, when you can come, and confirm that you have all the help you need to move everything.  (I’ll answer questions, but only if you provide the above information first.)Cheap: I am also selling four wood wine racks (12 bottles each) and a large metal one.  Six antique  (or vintage) dining room chairs, a 6 hp outboard motor, and two electric trolling motors.  All worked the last time they were used, but that was a long time ago.  Motivated seller — first reasonable offer on all the above, and lower prices if you take some free stuff.\n",

Large file cabinet for legal-sized folders, a big and sturdy bookcase, and a redwood picnic table. I have some small sets of shelves, office chairs, a hutch, dinner wear, and small tables for free, too, but you have to take a big item to take one of those.Tell me which you want, when you can come, and confirm that you have all the help you need to move everything.  (I’ll answer questions, but only if you provide the above information first.)Cheap: I am also selling four wood wine racks (12 bottles each) and a large metal one.  Six antique  (or vintage) dining room chairs, a 6 hp outboard motor, and two electric trolling motors.  All worked the last time they were used, but that was a long time ago.  Motivated seller — first reasonable offer on all the above, and lower prices if you take some free stuff.\n",
