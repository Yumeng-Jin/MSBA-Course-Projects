His practical critique of common mispractices provides useful real-world insights.    \n",

    "4) Implications for Research Integrity: The paper emphasizes the ethical dimension of research design, advocating for a clear separation between the design and analysis phases to prevent bias. This lesson on the importance of ethical research practices is a critical takeaway for conducting scientifically valid research.  "
